<h2> Invited talks </h2>

<p> <span class="strong"> Openness and simplicity in dynamic systems implementation </span>
    <br /><span class="emph"> Ian Piumarta </span> </p>

<p> The talk will describe a basis for constructing systems (programming
languages, environments and applications) in which users can be
encouraged to adapt the characteristics of the system to match their
needs (rather than the other way round).  Such systems can be evolved
from a pair of abstractions for state (objects communicating by
messaging) and behaviour (first-class functions) that are mutually
supporting: objects form structures representing symbolic expressions
that fully describe the message sequencing and sending that are needed
to implement objects.  The result is extreme late-binding (nothing in
the system is immune from dynamic modification) and extreme simplicity
(each abstraction can be written down in a handful of lines of
mathematics, and only slightly more lines of code). </p>

<p> Ian Piumarta is a computer scientist at Viewpoints Research Institute.
He spends much of his time designing and building systems whose
implementations are maximally open, reflexive, dynamically
self-describing and understandable.  He can be contacted at squeakland
dot org. </p>

<p> <span class="strong"> Perl 6 </span>
    <br /><span class="emph"> Audrey Tang </span> </p>

<p> Perl is a general-purpose language, known for its vast number of freely
available libraries.  The Perl 6 project was started to improve the
language's support for multi-paradigmatic programming, while retaining
compatibility with the existing code base. </p>

<p> This talk discusses how Perl 6 attempts to reconcile various competing
paradigms in the field of programming language design, such as static
vs. dynamic typechecking, nominal vs. structural subtyping, prototype
vs. class-based objects, and lazy vs. eager evaluation. </p>

<p> Moreover, this talk also covers the design and development of Pugs, a
self-hosting Perl 6 implementation bootstrapped from Haskell, targeting
multiple runtime environments, including Perl 5, JavaScript and Parrot. </p>

<p> Audrey Tang is a Taiwanese free software programmer, best known for
initiating and leading the Pugs project, a joint effort from Haskell and
Perl communities to implement the Perl 6 language. </p>

<p> She is also known for internationalization and localization
contributions to several Free Software programs, including SVK, Kwiki,
Request Tracker and Slash, as well as heading Traditional Chinese
translation efforts for various Open Source-related books. </p>

<p> On the CPAN, Tang initiated over 100 Perl projects, including the
popular Perl Archive Toolkit (PAR), a cross-platform packaging and
deployment tool for Perl 5. She is also responsible for setting up smoke
test and digital signature systems for CPAN. </p>

<p> Tang is a high school dropout and a vocal proponent for autodidacticism
and individualist anarchism. </p>

<p> <span class="strong"> Data Refactoring for Amateurs </span>
    <br /><span class="emph"> Avi Bryant </span> </p>

<p> Agile software development methodologies such as Extreme Programming
advocate iterative design via incremental, test-driven code extension
and automated refactorings.  When the goal is to allow non-developers to
build their own solutions, even in a limited way, this approach to
incrementality becomes even more important -- non-developers generally
have even less of the design experience necessary to make reasonable
decisions up front, and need real use and concrete examples to guide
their decisions.  Dabble DB is a commercial data management tool aimed
at casual business users.  It encourages users to evolve data models
slowly over time, starting with untyped and de-normalized models and
proceeding to more sophisticated models only as the need becomes
apparent.  We introduce a set of data refactorings designed to support
this usage pattern, and show selected examples of their real-world use. </p>

<p> Avi Bryant is the co-CEO of Smallthought Systems Inc., a Vancouver
startup focused on web-based collaboration tools.  He is the author and
maintainer of the Seaside web application framework, and is active in
the open source Squeak Smalltalk community. </p>
