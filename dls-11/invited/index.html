<h2> Invited talks </h2>

<p> <span class="strong"> A Walk on the Dart Side </span> <br />
    <span class="emph"> Gilad Bracha (Google, USA) </span></p>

<!--
<p> Dart is a pure object-oriented, dynamically typed language with actor based concurrency. We'll take a quick tour of the Dart programming language, focusing on its more unusual features, such as optional typing and built-in factory support. </p>
-->

<p> Gilad Bracha is the creator of the Newspeak programming language and a software engineer at Google. Previously, he was a VP at SAP Labs, a Distinguished Engineer at Cadence, and a Computational Theologist and Distinguished Engineer at Sun. He is co-author of the Java Language Specification, and a researcher in the area of object-oriented programming languages. Prior to joining Sun, he worked on Strongtalk, the Animorphic Smalltalk System. He received his  B.Sc in Mathematics and Computer Science from Ben Gurion University in Israel and a Ph.D. in Computer Science from the University of Utah. </p>

<p> <span class="strong"> Everything You Know (About Parallel Programming) is Wrong!: A Wild Screed About the Future </span> <br />
	<span class="emph"> David Ungar (IBM Research, USA) </span></p>

<!--
><p> In the 1970’s, researchers at Xerox PARC gave themselves a glimpse of the future by building computers that, although wildly impractical at the time, let them experience plentiful fast cycles and big memories. PARC researchers invented Smalltalk, and the freedom afforded by such a dynamic, yet safe, language, led them to create a new experience of computing, which has become quite mainstream today. </p>

<p> In the end of the first decade of the new century, chips such as Tilera’s can give us a glimpse of a future in which manycore microprocessors will become commonplace: every (non-hand-held) computer’s CPU chip will contain 1,000 fairly homogeneous cores. Such a system will not be programmed like the cloud, or even a cluster because communication will be much faster relative to computation. Nor will it be programmed like today’s multicore processors because the illusion of instant memory coherency will have been dispelled by both the physical limitations imposed by the 1,000-way fan-in to the memory system, and the comparatively long physical lengths of the inter- vs. intra-core connections. In the 1980’s we changed our model of computation from static to dynamic, and when this future arrives we will have to change our model of computation yet again. </p>

<p> If we cannot skirt Amdahl’s Law, the last 900 cores will do us no good whatsoever. What does this mean? We cannot afford even tiny amounts of serialization. Locks?! Even lock-free algorithms will not be parallel enough. They rely on instructions that require communication and synchronization between cores’ caches. Just as we learned to embrace languages without static type checking, and with the ability to shoot ourselves in the foot, we will need to embrace a style of programming without any synchronization whatsoever. </p>

<p> In our Renaissance project at IBM, Brussels, and Portland State, (http://soft.vub.ac.be/~smarr/renaissance/) we are investigating what we call “anti-lock,” “race-and-repair,” or “end-to-end nondeterministic” computing. As part of this effort, we have build a Smalltalk system that runs on the 64-core Tilera chip, and have experimented with dynamic languages atop this system. When we give up synchronization, we of necessity give up determinism. There seems to be a fundamental tradeoff between determinism and performance, just as there once seemed to be a tradeoff between static checking and performance. </p>

<p> The obstacle we shall have to overcome, if we are to successfully program manycore systems, is our cherished assumption that we write programs that always get the exactly right answers. This assumption is deeply embedded in how we think about programming. The folks who build web search engines already understand, but for the rest of us, to quote Firesign Theatre: Everything You Know Is Wrong! </p>

<p> David Ungar is an out-of-the-box thinker who enjoys the challenge of building computer software systems that work like magic and fit a user's mind like a glove. He received the 2009 Dahl-Nygaard award for outstanding career contributions in the field of object-orientation, and was honored as an ACM Fellow in 2010. Three of his papers have been honored by the Association for Computing Machinery for lasting impact over ten to twenty-four years: for the design of the prototype-based Self language, dynamic optimization techniques, and the application of cartoon animation ideas to user interfaces. He enjoys a position at IBM Research, where he is taking on a new challenge: investigating how application programmers can exploit manycore systems, and testing those ideas to see if they can help scale up analytics. </p>
